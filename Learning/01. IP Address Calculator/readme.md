About this project:
It's an IP address calculator, based on Host's IP and MAC, it will calculate it's Network IP and Broadcasting IP.

This project helped me learn many aspects of arrays use, how to perform bitwise operations, and made me understand loops a little bit better.

Already done:
- calculating address from IP and full MAC
- calculating address from IP shortened version of MAC
- outputing it to the user

Planned features:
- calculating address by IP class when user does not provide a MAC address
- calculation first host, last host, and maximum number of hosts
