About this project:
It's an IP address calculator, based on Host's IP and MAC, it will calculate it's Network IP and Broadcasting IP.

This project helped me learn many aspects of arrays use, how to perform bitwise operations, and made me understand loops a little bit better.

Already done:
- calculating address from full MAC and IP
- outputing it to the user

Planned features:
- calculating address from short MAC
- calculating address by IP class when user does not provide a MAC address.
